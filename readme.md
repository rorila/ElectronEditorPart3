## Summary 

This is a very basic text editor. Created using ElectronJS

You can read about how this application is created by following a three part tutorial.

#### [Part one](https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/creating-a-text-editor-in-electron-reading-files-13b8)

## Room for improvements?

You bet!

This project was simply to explore some of the features of Electron. There's a lot that can be done here, some of which can be 

- Checking whether a file already exists.
- Dealing with unsaved files when moving between them.
- Actually convert content to markdown.
- Store content using innerText rather than innerHTML.
- And many more things which might be even more important than the above.
- Better file organisation 

But none of those will be added in this repository, the basic code here corresponds to the code snippets used in the tutorials.
